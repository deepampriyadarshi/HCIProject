# Hand-Gesture univeral remote control for all Smart TVs

This project is based on creating a universal TV remote that works based on the **Hand Gestures** made by the users. The gestures are simply ***touching the tip of the thumb with tip of every other finger***. In this this way you four functionalities mapped to the fingers of your left hand and two on you right hand. For recognizing the gestures we hae used Google Mediapipe pretrained model based on single shot detection system and it doesn't rquire any kind of GPU acceleration.
